## Using (S)FTP{.margin-top-hard}

[Download the latest version.](http://morfy.org/download)  

Unzip the contents to a new folder on your local computer, and upload to your webhost using the (S)FTP client of your choice. After youâ€™ve done this, be sure to chmod the following directories (with containing files) to `777`, so they are readable and writable by Morfy:  
* `cache/`
* `config/`
* `storage/`
* `themes/`
* `plugins/`

## Using Composer

You can easily install Morfy with Composer.

```
composer create-project morfy-cms/morfy
```

Also you may need to install vendor libs for Default Theme
```
cd /morfy/themes/default  
bower install
```
